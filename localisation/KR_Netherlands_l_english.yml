HOL_privatization_of_projects_desc:0 "Our investments have borne fruit: companies are expressing their interest in taking over some of our national projects in hopes of making a profit off of them.

HOL_repay_government_debts_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact of life that money does not grow on trees, and the government has been forced to issue a number of bonds and requested loans from foreign investors in order to fill the void. It is imperative that we pay these debts off sooner rather than later."
HOL_control_inflation:0 "인플레이션 통제"
HOL_control_inflation_desc:0 "With inflation still uncomfortably high as a result of Black Monday we must enact deflationary measures to get it under control, for example by demanding that bank reserve rates be increased so that they are forced to hold onto more capital.

HOL_restore_regulation:0 "위기 전 규제의 부활"
HOL_restore_regulation_desc:0 "The somewhat brutal policies of the Black Monday years have served their purpose well, incentivising business and getting government spending. All the same, it is vital that we restore our nation's lost confidence by restoring some of their long-deserved privileges."

HOL_startup_tax_cuts_desc:0 "Small and medium sized businesses, or 'SMEs' are the bedrock upon which Holland's greatness rests.

HOL_big_corp_tax_cuts_desc:0 "It goes without saying that our large corporations are vital to our future economic success.

HOL_guns_for_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "As we are considered a relatively impartial third party, we find ourselves in the useful position of being able to sell weapons to whomever we desire. The Kaiserreich is the leading hegemon of continental Europe, and it needs guns. We can oblige them."

HOL_SDAP_question_desc:0 "With the Netherlands entering a new socio-political order, the time has come to consider whether to allow the somewhat centrist 사회민주노동당 to stand for election to the assembly that will decide the nation's future. It may be a Trojan Horse for reactionism."

HOL_council_of_the_state_desc:0 "The Council-Communists under Anton Pannekoek and his 네덜란드 공산노동당 have taken a majority in the new Assembly, becoming the leading constituents of the Volksraad executive body.

HOL_vakbondsfederatie_desc:0 "The Assembly's majority choice appeared to be the syndicalist 전국노동사무국 party under Harm Kolthek, who has called for Communard-style rule under a 'federation of trade unions'. The most 'orthodox' of the serious leftist groups in the state, the 전국노동사무국 was a clear compromise between all involved."
HOL_socialist_republic:0 "사회주의 공화국"
HOL_socialist_republic_desc:0 "Henk Sneevliet's radical socialist 혁명사회노동당 party has been elected with a majority by the Assembly as the new government.

HOL_social_democracy:0 "사회민주주의"
HOL_social_democracy_desc:0 "Shocking many of those present in the Assembly, it appears that the Volksraad elected was indeed that of the moderate 사회민주노동당 under Willem Albard.

HOL_peoples_military:0 "인민의 군대"
HOL_peoples_military_desc:0 "The revolution did not transpire just so it could be derailed by vested interests and imperialists within our own armed forces. Serious reforms must be undertaken if we are to purge it of dangerous malefactors and preserve the Commune."

HOL_block_german_trade_desc:0 "For too long the bastion of imperialism to our east has posed an existential threat to all that is good and righteous in this world. Germany's efforts to smother the working class wherever it exists mean continuing trade with would be absurd."
HOL_tolerate_german_trade:0 "독일과의 무역 허용"
HOL_tolerate_german_trade_desc:0 "For many the idea of accepting the new reality of socialist rule meant sending our nation on a collision cause with the behemoth that is the Kaiserreich. The government however, has decided that continued relations with Germany only serve to benefit our nation."

HOL_reijnders_putsch_desc:0 "네덜란드군 사령관인 이자크 레인데어스가 암스테르담에서, 국가가 위험한 생디칼리슴적 전복에 빠져버릴 위험에 처해 있다며 군사 쿠데타를 시작하는 충격적인 사태가 벌어졌습니다. 네덜란드의 운명은, 현재로서는... 불확실합니다."
HOL_VNH_victory:0 "국가재건연합 선거 승리"
HOL_VNH_victory_desc:0 "국가재건연합은 최근의 선거에서 놀랄만한 승리를 거두면서 보수적인 기독국민동맹을 대체하고 이 나라를 불확실하게 만들었습니다. 새 정부가 할 일은 아직 확실하지 않습니다."
HOL_CNA_gamble_worked:0 "기독국민동맹의 도박놀음은 끝났다"
HOL_CNA_gamble_worked_desc:0 "The ruling 기독국민동맹 has managed to score yet another electoral victory, continuing its unopposed rule of the nation. All the same, its majority has shrunk and it may have to find a coalition partner to continue with the authority and mandate it once had. Still, the status quo remains - for now."
HOL_junta_consolidation:0 "군사 정부 강화"
HOL_junta_consolidation_desc:0 "With the putsch having been a complete success, it is now incumbent on the powers that be to formalise their rule. By consolidating the members of the new provisional military junta in charge of the Netherlands, some much needed stability will be granted to a weary nation."
HOL_intimidate_parliament:0 "의회 협박"
HOL_intimidate_parliament_desc:0 "The new status quo cannot be guaranteed without Parliament being bullied into handing over emergency powers. Such measures might be unpleasant, but they are necessary to stave off syndicalist revolt."
HOL_alliance_of_the_right:0 "우파의 동맹"
HOL_alliance_of_the_right_desc:0 "Holland's problems cannot be solved by one party alone. There must be unity in purpose between nationalists and conservatives if this nation is to be saved from the dangers of radical thinking."

HOL_CNA_on_its_own_desc:0 "We do not need any other. Holland has only one guiding hand, and it will continue to preserve society until its dying breath, God willing."
HOL_work_with_LSP:0 "자유국가당과 함께 한다"
HOL_work_with_LSP_desc:0 "If we have to work with others, then we could do no worse than the market liberal 자유국가당. While our beliefs are primarily social, theirs tend to stress economic concerns. It is a compromise that does not pose too many problems, at least in comparison to our other 'choices'."
HOL_martial_law_in_europe:0 "계엄령 선포"
HOL_martial_law_in_europe_desc:0 "우리의 새 정권을 보호하기 위해서는, 즉시 단속을 시작하고 국가의 정치적 위기를 해결하기 위한 우리의 의지를 보여주는 것이 시급합니다. 유럽에서의 계엄령을 선포함으로써 우리는 네덜란드를 위험으로부터 구하려는 우리의 결의를 분명히 할 수 있을 것입니다."
HOL_rebuild_binnenhof:0 "빈넨호프 재건"
HOL_rebuild_binnenhof_desc:0 "The Binnenhof is a near-sacred institution in the Netherlands, and the arson that destroyed it to many represents a clear symbol of the decay of our state and its slide into political madness. By rebuilding it we might send a widespread signal of what we hope to achieve for the future."
HOL_red_scare:0 "적색 공포"
HOL_red_scare_desc:0 "The threat that the forces of socialism and treacherous syndicalism poses to our way of life cannot be underestimated. It is time that we begin making this clear to the people, if they have not already grasped a fact as basic and immutable as gravity itself."
HOL_amend_ambtenarenverbod:0 "Amend the Ambtenarenverbod"
HOL_amend_ambtenarenverbod_desc:0 "The civil service ban has proven to be insufficient for protecting our fragile political system from subversion. By amending the legislation behind it to weigh it further in our favour, we can weaken the grasp of leftist groups over the apparatus of state."
HOL_influence_legal_system:0 "법 체계 전복"
HOL_influence_legal_system_desc:0 "Dangerous times call for desperate measures. Though it pains the conservative element in our government dearly, it is vital that government influence over the nation's legal system and judiciary be extended to allow us to tackle the threats facing us."
HOL_dissolve_landwacht_RNF:0 "란트바흐트 해체"
HOL_dissolve_landwacht_RNF_desc:0 "란트바흐트는 국가에 대한 국가재건연합 국민주의자들의 이익과 일치하므로, 필요할 경우 무력을 써서라도 반드시 폐지되어야 합니다. 네덜란드에서 허용될 수 있는 유일한 준군사단체는 우리 소유입니다."
HOL_syndie_crackdown:0 "생디칼리슴 탄압"
HOL_syndie_crackdown_desc:0 "Our nation has allowed those that seek to do it harm to wander its streets unmolested for years. This sad state of affairs must end if we are to preserve the independence of Holland in the face of despicable Red forces arrayed against us in the south and west."
HOL_break_up_soc_pillar:0 "사회주의 기둥 파괴"
HOL_break_up_soc_pillar_desc:0 "While the Socialist pillar has until now been a mostly tolerable focal point for more legitimate and less violent dissent against conservative rule of Holland, it poses a threat that goes far beyond the sum of its parts. The institutions such as the trade unions could hide syndicalist sympathisers, and this is intolerable."
HOL_anthem_in_schools:0 "학교내 국가 의무제창"
HOL_anthem_in_schools_desc:0 "As part of a wider systematic policy to encourage nationalist fervour in the country in the face of leftist opposition, a proposal has been put forward of some interest; ensure that the national anthem, the Het Wilhelmus, is compulsory in school classrooms."
HOL_new_flag_protocol:0 "새로운 국기 프로토콜"
HOL_new_flag_protocol_desc:0 "One simple manner by which we can rekindle the spark of Dutch pride in our countrymen is to codify a new flag protocol. New rules governing how to treat the national flag, including its waving, its treatment and criminal penalties for mistreatment, would all be cheap yet popular."
HOL_nationalist_renaissance:0 "국수주의자 르네상스"
HOL_nationalist_renaissance_desc:0 "It doesn't take much to make a Dutchman love their country, it is an easy land to love after all. All the same, it is impressive how fast a few simple policies have managed to unite vast numbers of people around our country's political future."
HOL_queens_speech:0 "여왕의 연설"
HOL_queens_speech_desc:0 "While Her Majesty has mostly sought to stay clear of politics in recent months, befitting her position and royal dignity, it has increasingly become clear that the new regime is here to stay and as such it appears that she may soon publicly announce her tacit support for it, at least for the moment."
HOL_secret_police:0 "비밀 경찰 설립"
HOL_secret_police_desc:0 "The current state security apparatus is insufficient for our needs, that much is clear. By establishing an entirely new branch of the police, linked with intelligence and military divisions, we can help preserve Holland's stability."
HOL_papua_camps:0 "파푸아 수용소"
HOL_papua_camps_desc:0 "By establishing new prison camps on distant Papua in our East Indies colonies, we shall have a place to which we can banish all syndicalists that pose a threat to the nation. Nobody would foolish enough to try to escape on an island filled with cannibals and man-eating creatures, after all."
HOL_landwacht_as_citizen_guard:0 "란트바흐트 합법화를 시도"
HOL_landwacht_as_citizen_guard_desc:0 "The Landwacht has an image problem, that much is obvious. However, if we attempt to portray them as citizen guards and drill that message into the populace enough, it may just be enough to cover up their glaring flaws. Actually correcting them as an organisation will have to come later."
HOL_outlaw_unions:0 "노조 불법화"
HOL_outlaw_unions_desc:0 "The trade unions, those bastions of syndicalist ideology, pose an existential threat to our nation. By bringing in legislation that challenges the power of the trade unions enough to essentially consign them to history, we can end their despicable influence."
HOL_spreading_the_revolution:0 "혁명 확산"
HOL_spreading_the_revolution_desc:0 "As a syndicalist nation in Europe it is vital that we play our part in the struggle for the working class. To do otherwise would be a gross dereliction of our duty."

HOL_idea_south_africa_in_exile_desc:0 "This country hosts a Boer government in exile in The Hague, where it claims to be the legitimate government of South Africa."
HOL_idea_convention_host:0 "국제 회의 주최"
HOL_idea_convention_host_desc:0 "This country is renowned for hosting multiple international conventions, making it harder for potential invaders to justify their attack."
HOL_batavian_committee_of_science:0 "바타비아 과학 위원회"
HOL_batavian_committee_of_science_desc:0 "By nationalising the assets of research companies and placing them under the oversight of one committee by, for and with the people, we will be able to conduct research far more efficiently."
HOL_dutch_researching:0 "네덜란드 연구소"
HOL_dutch_researching_desc:0 "With Flanders in friendly hands, we can combine our research and share it faster with local scientists using the Dutch language. This will be a great boon to our research capabilities."
HOL_royalist_sentiment_transferred:0 "Exploit Royalist Sentiment"
HOL_royalist_sentiment_transferred_desc:0 "With the Queen's backing, our junta has been given the modicum of legitimacy that it needed to bring a number of undecided moderates over to our way of thinking. Now increasingly viewed as the saviours of a troubled nation, our position is becoming far safer."
HOL_order_of_orange_nassau:0 "오라녜나사우 훈장"
HOL_order_of_orange_nassau_desc:0 "The chivalric Order of Orange-Nassau exists to reward those that give their all to the Dutch people, either on the battlefield or in the civilian sphere. With the support of the monarchy, we can begin to use the order for our own political and military ends."
HOL_permanent_stability:0 "영구적인 안정"
HOL_permanent_stability_desc:0 "It has become clear to all that there is no way that the people can be left to their own devices. Inevitably populist figures on the left and right will rise to hijack their passions and fears, plunging the nation into chaos. There is only one rational path forwards - an end to elections."
HOL_restore_democracy:0 "민주주의 복원"
HOL_restore_democracy_desc:0 "The dangers of syndicalism and populism have been averted. There is no more need for a correctionary junta and the time has come to restore democratic rule to the Netherlands."
HOL_VNH_crackdown:0 "국가재건연합 강력 탄압"
HOL_VNH_crackdown_desc:0 "란트바흐트는 탄압받고 있지만, 국가재건연합은 돈으로 사람을 부리면서 여전히 국내에서 활동하고 있습니다. 우리나라에 위협이 되는 것은 좌파 뿐만 아니라 국민주의 단체이기도 합니다."
HOL_zonderlinge_zaterdag:0 "별난 토요일"
HOL_zonderlinge_zaterdag_desc:0 "국가재건연합의 개혁은 지금까지 효과가 있었고, 국가는 어느 정도 정치적으로 그리고 경제적으로 회복되고 있습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, '별난 토요일' 사건은 안정에 대한 이전의 모든 개념을 종식시킬 수도 있습니다."
HOL_staatsvakbond:0 "국립 노조"
HOL_staatsvakbond_desc:0 "The Dutch people have a newfound sense of pride, however with the loss of traditional pillars and outlets such as the unions, their anger and zeal might be directed our way. By instituting new state-led trade unions, we can diffuse and disarm these feelings, and potentially redirect them towards our enemies."
HOL_van_geelkerkens_arrest:0 "반 힐케어컨의 체포"
HOL_van_geelkerkens_arrest_desc:0 "반 힐케어컨이 스와르트를 강제 퇴진시키려는 시도에 실패한 바로 지금, 우리는 가능한 한 많은 정치적 영향력을 확보해두는 것이 중요합니다. 강경파의 쿠데타 야망을 무너뜨림으로써, 우리의 중도주의적 이미지는 더욱 강해지고 우리의 인기는 새로운 절정에 다다를 것입니다."
HOL_swarts_retirement:0 "스와르트의 퇴진"
HOL_swarts_retirement_desc:0 "반 힐케어컨은 성공적으로 스와르트를 대통령직에서 강제 퇴진시켰고, 네덜란드에 훨씬 더 극단적인 사상과 성향을 주입했습니다. 특히 몇몇 국가재건연합 충성파들의 불명예스러운 비밀이 줄줄이 누설된 지금의 상황에서, 새로운 정국의 혼란은 놀라울 정도로 잘 진정되었다고 할 수 있겠습니다."
HOL_reform_landwacht:0 "란트바흐트 개혁"
HOL_reform_landwacht_desc:0 "란트바흐트는 우리가 정권을 확보하고 보호하는 데 대단히 도움되었습니다. 하지만 이들은 우리 정부 뿐만 아니라 나머지 준군사조직들에까지 좋지 않은 본보기들을 많이 가지고 있습니다. 상황이 바뀌어야만 합니다."
HOL_landwacht_part_of_army:0 "란트바흐트를 육군에 통합"
HOL_landwacht_part_of_army_desc:0 "군대는 너무 오랫동안 국가재건연합 등의 나약한 인자들에게 지배당해왔습니다. 상황을 변화시키려면 우리는 충성스러운 란트바흐트 전사들을 정규군의 곳곳으로 흡수시켜야 합니다. 이 모자란 멍청이들을 더 확실히 통제하려면 말입니다."
HOL_new_era:0 "네덜란드 군정"
HOL_new_era_desc:0 "우리는 네덜란드를 심연에서 구해냈고, 우리는 한껏 의기양양해져 있습니다. 하지만 불행하게도 평화는 잠깐일 뿐이며, 우리는 정부에 군의 통제를 연계시키기 위해 노력해야만 합니다. 군대와 국가가 함께 조국의 위대함을 보존할 것입니다."
HOL_dutch_apartheid:0 "지도자와 조국을 위해!"
HOL_dutch_apartheid_desc:0 "암스테르담에서 가장 높은 탑의 서까래에서부터, 가장 낮은 운하의 기슭까지 '지도자와 조국을 위해'라는 함성이 울려퍼집니다. 우리의 새로운 질서가 마침내 준비되었고, 우리는 진군하고 있습니다. 지도자를 위해서, 조국을 위해서."
HOL_tighten_ambtenarenverbod:0 "공무원 규제령 제정"
HOL_tighten_ambtenarenverbod_desc:0 "정부와 행정기관 내에서 극단주의적 영향의 물결을 막고자 하는 우리의 목표에는 공무원들에 대한 규제가 미흡했습니다. 우리는 위험한 이념을 더 효과적으로 걸러내기 위해 법률을 제정해야만 합니다."
HOL_entrench_pillarization:0 "Entrench Pillarisation"
HOL_entrench_pillarization_desc:0 "The pillars are the foundation upon which Dutch society stands. Without them there can be no stability. At every opportunity we must embrace and bolster our cultural and democratic institutions."
HOL_ban_paramilitaries:0 "준군사조직 금지"
HOL_ban_paramilitaries_desc:0 "On both the left and right paramilitaries such as the Red Front and Landwacht have caused us disconcerting amounts of problems. This will end. Now."
HOL_gov_support_for_pillars:0 "Support the Pillars"
HOL_gov_support_for_pillars_desc:0 "We have begun implementing substantive acts and proposals intended to bolster the traditional pillars of Dutch society, for example through incentivising church attendance and encouraging Dutch footballers to travel for games overseas to the adulation of radio listeners."
HOL_paramilitary_crackdown:0 "준군사조직 진압"
HOL_paramilitary_crackdown_desc:0 "While we have implemented law banning paramilitary organisations, the time has come to truly enforce them. By cracking down hard on these undemocratic groups, we will strike a blow that will send the radicals scurrying back to their foreign paymasters. The security of the Netherlands depends on it."
HOL_pillar_crumbling_stopped:0 "The Pillars Preserved"
HOL_pillar_crumbling_stopped_desc:0 "Our efforts to inspire confidence in the traditional pillars have not gone unnoticed, and increasingly members of the public are coming to recognise the righteousness of our intervention in otherwise off-limit cultural and social affairs. Our actions are paying off."
HOL_dissolution_of_NAS:0 "전국노동사무국 소멸"
HOL_dissolution_of_NAS_desc:0 "Outlawing the primary syndicalist party in the Netherlands is critical if our efforts are to have any chance of succeeding. Inspired by Communard French demagogues, this movement is a menace to all Dutch society."
HOL_ban_RSAP:0 "혁명사회노동당 불법화"
HOL_ban_RSAP_desc:0 "While the radical socialists are not quite as dangerous as other, more extreme left-wing groups, they are a danger to society. Their programmes and manifesto are persuasive to a number of lower class workers and intellectuals, making them a key target."
HOL_ban_patriotten:0 "애국당 금지"
HOL_ban_patriotten_desc:0 "The Patriotten are a virulent disease, the likes of which the Netherlands hasn't seen for many years. It is so hard-left that it poses as much as threat to other syndicalist ideologies as our own. Self-destructive impulses aside, we must suppress such groups."
HOL_ban_VNH:0 "국가재건연합 금지"
HOL_ban_VNH_desc:0 "좌익 세력을 지하로 몰아내면서, 극우파의 위협을 완전히 무너뜨리는 것이 점점 더 중요해지고 있습니다. 국가재건연합의 더 극단적인 요소는 입맛에 맞는 단체를 국가의 잠재적 위험으로 만들 것이고, 그렇기 때문에 국가재건연합은 법을 통해 무너져야 합니다."
HOL_razzia_for_undergrounds:0 "지하조직 습격 시작"
HOL_razzia_for_undergrounds_desc:0 "With many extremist groups forced underground, that leaves them with only one remaining place for us to target. We will launch a major police operation and bring down the remnants of these hateful groups, no matter the cost."
HOL_stable_once_again:0 "안정을 되찾자!"
HOL_stable_once_again_desc:0 "It has been a hard road, but with our serious ideological opposition now consigned to prison cells, foreign shores or an early grave, perhaps now the Netherlands might be able to rest easy."
HOL_negotiate_with_the_left:0 "좌파와 협상"
HOL_negotiate_with_the_left_desc:0 "If we are to ensure that politics in the Netherlands remains relatively unbesmirched by extremism, it is important that we consider negotiating with some of the more moderate elements of the left to ensure stability."
HOL_limit_working_week:0 "제한된 복지"
HOL_limit_working_week_desc:0 "A number of limited welfare reforms and incentives might just be enough to get the leftist groups on side. The question is whether or not they are acceptable to all involved."
HOL_limit_RNF:0 "적색 전선 제한"
HOL_limit_RNF_desc:0 "The left-wing Red Front paramilitaries pose a serious threat to civil order in our nation. We must demand some level of action be taken on them."
HOL_limited_minimum_wage:0 "코뮌을 사실상 인정"
HOL_limited_minimum_wage_desc:0 "A number of leftists regularly demand that we recognise syndicalist regimes such as that of the Commune of France. While de-jure recognition is definitely unpalatable to many rightist groups, if not totally out of the question, perhaps token recognition could be proposed."
HOL_limit_NAS:0 "전국노동사무국 제한"
HOL_limit_NAS_desc:0 "It is vital that we demand that at least some measures be taken against the 전국노동사무국, a union of orthodox syndicalists that have the most moral legitimacy of most hard-left groups in the country. The question is, how far should we go in our demands?"
HOL_protection_against_np:0 "란트바흐트로부터 보호"
HOL_protection_against_np_desc:0 "The Landwacht are a distinctly nationalist group of paramilitaries that regularly cause serious harm to left-wing activists and street marchers. No doubt the negotiations will centre on us assisting the leftists against them in some manner."
HOL_limit_socialist_parties:0 "사회주의의 영향을 최소화"
HOL_limit_socialist_parties_desc:0 "One area that is critical for us is to limit the power of the radical socialist 혁명사회노동당, the only hard-left group with parliamentary representation. They have a been a major thorn in our side, and so the negotiations would be a good chance of removing them."
HOL_negotiations_succeeded:0 "협상 타결!"
HOL_negotiations_succeeded_desc:0 "Our willingness to concede on a few points, and the surprising willingness of our political rivals to come to terms, means that the negotiations have proven to be a relative success for all involved."
HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_right:0 "Cordon Sanitaire Against the Right"
HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_right_desc:0 "With the power of the leftists limited to a reasonable extent by our negotiations, it is time for us to unite against the forces of far-right extremism within the Netherlands."
HOL_democratic_survival:0 "네덜란드의 민주주의는 살아남았다!"

HOL_negotiate_with_the_right:0 "우파와 협상"
HOL_negotiate_with_the_right_desc:0 "비록 이상적인 상황은 아닐지라도, 네덜란드 정치에 평화의 척도를 가져오기 위해 국민주의 국가재건연합 운동의 덜 극단적인 요소들과 협상하는 것이 가장 좋을 것입니다."
HOL_limit_landwacht:0 "란트바흐트의 활동 제한"
HOL_limit_landwacht_desc:0 "A key part of the deal rests on the Landwacht, the right-wing 국가재건연합 paramilitary group responsible for breaking leftist skulls in recent street marches. While we could demand that they be dissolved, pushing the point too hard might alienate even some relatively moderate 국가재건연합 members."
HOL_limit_union_rights:0 "노조권리축소"
HOL_limit_union_rights_desc:0 "If there is one thing that we can all agree on, it is that the threat posed by syndicalism and its trade union backers is existential. However, the 국가재건연합's demands that we seriously damage them might prove to be destabilising anathema to the Dutch working class."
HOL_limit_influence_military:0 "군의 영향 축소"
HOL_limit_influence_military_desc:0 "A number of senior army figures are public members of the 국가재건연합, even if less politically noxious than others. All the same, we must make limiting the 국가재건연합's influence on our armed forces contingent on any deal we sign with them. We cannot allow the risk of a coup."
HOL_limited_tariffs:0 "관세 인하"
HOL_limited_tariffs_desc:0 "The 국가재건연합 has demanded that we lower economic tarrifs on imported goods, somewhat contrary to their nationalist leanings. While doing so might gain their support, it may prove to be unpopular with the people once cheap goods flood onto the market undercutting local businesses."
HOL_limit_populist_parties:0 "포퓰리즘 정당 제한"
HOL_limit_populist_parties_desc:0 "One demand that we must make of the 국가재건연합 is to consider their position on allowing constant party rallies. At these rallies a number of young Dutchmen are being radicalised by more extremist elements within the 국가재건연합."
HOL_limit_foreign_assets:0 "독일인 재산 국유화"
HOL_limit_foreign_assets_desc:0 "Unbelievably, one of the 국가재건연합's demands is that we seize German property in the country. Though this might be incredibly dangerous, the 국가재건연합 have made it a major demand, and as such we cannot simply ignore it."
HOL_r_negotiations_succeeded:0 "협상 타결!"
HOL_r_negotiations_succeeded_desc:0 "It appears that the more moderate wing of the 국가재건연합 were not so unreasonable after all. With their support in neutralising the threat from the far-right elements within the nationalist movement, we can now turn our attention to promoting peace throughout the Dutch political system."
HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_left:0 "Cordon Sanitaire Against the Left"
HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_left_desc:0 "It is all in place now. With support from moderate and right groups, we can stem the malign influence of radical left groups within our proud nation. It seems that finally the Netherlands will be stable once more."

There have even been reports of Landwacht-backed attempts to break into the SDAP party headquarters hoping to take control over membership records.

Within hours more forces stationed in the area had joined the revolt. Soon after this David Wijnkoop appeared on the radio through a hijacked radio station declaring that hatred towards the left 'is institutionalised' and that the Binnenhof Fire was a signal for a new revolution.\n\nWhen the national government tried to direct the military to put down the revolt it appeared a good part of the armed forces, even in the rest of the country, mutinied in favour of the reds.

This message appears to have been effective at resonating with the population, or at least with 국가재건연합 supporters, many of whom appeared to be more than happy to join the revolt.\n\nWhile initially sympathetic to the government, which had sought to block the revolt by using a broadcast by the Queen, the 국가재건연합's more moderate leadership decided to switch sides in favour of the rebellion, and a populist takeover seems almost inevitable."

This is in turn leading to growing sympathy amongst the population towards the political movements behind these organisations.\n\nIf we are to avoid membership of more extreme political ideologies growing, then we must stop this, though that will probably not be a popular measure."

What's worse, they are fighting each other for the sole right to sell liquor in certain areas. The police are far from capable of keeping this in check and as a result the Red Front and Landwacht have started to supplant them in keeping the streets safe. Either we rescind the prohibition and give in to criminals, or we keep things as they are, probably resulting in the extreme left and right taking credit for containing the cartels."
holpostel.22.a:0 "Abandon the prohibition."
holpostel.22.b:0 "Keep the prohibition."

holpostel.23.t:0 "'노동자는 맥주를 마시지 않는다!'"
holpostel.23.d:0 "'Arbeiders drinken geen bier' is the name of the syndicalist campaign to fight alcoholism in the working class, seeing it as method by which the reactionaries and capitalists keep the proletariat crushed underfoot. As alcoholism became a growing problem in the Netherlands, and with the governments unwillingness to act on it, independent conservative movements pursuing the same goal started to work together with the syndicalists, resulting in growing sympathy for both ideologies and increasing political polarisation."
holpostel.23.a:0 "Encourage private actions against alcoholism..."
holpostel.23.b:0 "...but not when syndicalism is involved!"

holpostel.24.t:0 "Populist Welfare"
holpostel.24.d:0 "Since the beginning of the crisis many sections of our welfare system have deteriorated, and the country is filled with unemployed people who can hardly obtain the food required to support their families. As a result, the 국가재건연합 has started a nationwide campaign distributing food to these areas and opening food banks and soup kitchens. These actions have created a lot of goodwill towards them and makes it look like, even though they are currently not in power, they are the ones who care for the people.\nWe could shut their project down, but risk inciting a great deal of anger amongst the working classes."
holpostel.24.a:0 "It's good for the people."
holpostel.24.b:0 "Shut it down."

holpostel.25.t:0 "전국노동사무국 Overtakes NVV"
holpostel.25.d:0 "The NVV, the most important social democratic union within the Netherlands for years, has, according to the latest CBS report, been overtaken by the syndicalist 전국노동사무국 in terms of membership.\nThis is a bad sign for the 사회민주노동당, as it sends a loud signal that their power base is quickly leaking away to the more radical side of Dutch politics. It also provides evidence that their pillar, so far fairly untouched by the ongoing process of depillarisation, is now undergoing the same crumbling that the other pillars have felt. The 전국노동사무국 becoming the most important trade union in the country has the potential to be very dangerous, therefore some voices in our government have called for an official announcement that we will not countenance any negotiations with the 전국노동사무국, hopefully limiting its appeal."
holpostel.25.a:0 "We do not negotiate with syndicalists."
holpostel.25.b:0 "We accept the new status quo."

holpostel.26.t:0 "Malieveld Protests"
holpostel.26.d:0 "A huge rally of radical socialists, syndicalists and other left-wing fringe movements has started on the Malieveld in The Hague.\nThey are protesting against what they call the rule of the capitalists and some even openly call for a revolution. The local police is wondering what they should be doing - should they crack down on the demonstration or let it run its course?"
holpostel.26.a:0 "Let the rally proceed."
holpostel.26.b:0 "Shut that red scum gathering down."

holpostel.27.t:0 "2월 파업"
holpostel.27.d:0 "오늘 아침, 암스테르담의 전차가 멈췄습니다. 같은 시각, 혁명사회노동당과 전국노동사무국 지지자들은 암스테르담의 회사들에 다음과 같은 성명서를 흩뿌렸습니다 - 파업, 파업, 파업! 오후가 되자 이는 총파업이 되었고, 밤에는 주변 하를렘, 힐베르섬, 위트레흐트 등으로 퍼지기 시작했습니다. 이 생디칼리슴이 조직한 파업이 네덜란드에서 전례가 없는 규모로 매우 빠르게 변하고 있는 것은 명확합니다.\n긴급회의가 헤이그에서 열리고 있고 세가지 선택이 고려되고 있습니다: 그들의 의견을 수용하기 (좌파가 원하는 방법일 것입니다), 파업이 끝나기를 기다리기 (산업에는 큰 해가 될 것입니다), 또는 파업 진압하기 (우파가 원하는 방법일 것입니다)."

holpostel.27.c:0 "놈들을 일터로 돌려보내라!"

holpostel.28.t:0 "2월 파업이 계속되다"
holpostel.28.d:0 "Our waiting strategy does not seem to be working so far, it has only emboldened the strikers, who have now been holding out for a whopping three months. Meanwhile, our economy remains largely still, and many who were earlier in favour of waiting the strike out are now advocating giving in to their demands. Unfortunately, the respect the syndicalists have gained during these days will only grow if we back down now."
holpostel.28.a:0 "백기를 들어라."
holpostel.28.b:0 "시간은 우리 편이다."
holpostel.28.c:0 "충분히 참았다, 쓸어버려라!"

holpostel.29.t:0 "파업자들이 직장으로 돌아가다"
holpostel.29.d:0 "After five months of continuous striking, it appears that finally the strikers are giving up. More and more workers have been returning to their workplaces in recent weeks, where they should be, and today the NAS has called off the strike without having gained any concessions.\n\nThis is a serious political blow to the radical left, who have been humiliated and no longer seen as being able to press their will. On top of that their monetary resources expended to maintain the strikers has depleted massively. Still, we ought to be careful, because we've won a battle, not the war."
holpostel.29.a:0 "이러면 어쩔 테냐, 빨갱이."

holpostel.30.t:0 "Radio Rood"
holpostel.30.d:0 "Founded by a group of Dutch syndicalist exiles, Radio Rood is a London-based radio station slandering 'the Dutch capitalist dictatorship' and calling for acts of resistance 'against the bourgeois pigs occupying our country'.\nThey are spreading lies about certain events happening here as well as making up events of their own and claiming that the legitimate media is ignoring these fact to keep the proletariat dumb. The problem is that there is a significant portion of our population who actually believes this rubbish, and we have little to no way to shut down a radio station based in a country our relations are hostile with, to say the least."
holpostel.30.a:0 "Confiscate every civilian radio!"
holpostel.30.b:0 "They don't harm anyone."

holpostel.31.t:0 "French Arms Smugglers Captured"
holpostel.31.d:0 "We have captured a group of French nationals carrying explosives across the Flemish-Walloon-Dutch border.\nThey won't explain their presence, nor the source of their explosives, and after a search the name of a prominent local syndicalist and a location was discovered in one of the men's pockets. Police arriving at the designated location did not find anyone present despite a prolonged search. According to the law, the smugglers will be designated 'unwanted foreigners' and evicted, but the Central Intelligence Service wants to interrogate the men; they might be affiliated with the Communard government which would make this an act of espionage."
holpostel.31.a:0 "Let the CI interrogate the foreigners."
holpostel.31.b:0 "Just evict them!"

holpostel.32.t:0 "French Nationals Confess"
holpostel.32.d:0 "The French nationals we apprehended at the border a few days ago came clean with their plans to the CI after the interrogation: apparently they sought to supply explosives to a local Sorelian-affiliated group in order to blow up the Amsterdam Centraal Station, the heart of our nation's train infrastructure, in an operation that is at least not directly attributable to the Communard government.\nThey have given up their contacts within our country and the police are ready to shut down every foreign Vanguardist terrorist cell residing within our country."
holpostel.32.a:0 "Roll them up and evict the French."

holpostel.33.t:0 "French Nationals Stay Silent"
holpostel.33.d:0 "Despite a prolonged interrogation, the CI has been unable to extract any meaningful information from the French nationals we captured at the border. They are now asking for explicit government sanction to use physical... arguments to convince them to speak. This would, strictly speaking, be unconstitutional, but they are syndicalist foreigners after all."
holpostel.33.a:0 "Permission granted."
holpostel.33.b:0 "No, just throw them out."

holpostel.34.t:0 "French Nationals Remain Silent"
holpostel.34.d:0 "Despite the extra rights granted to the CI in this case, the mysterious French nationals still do not seem willing to talk. Continuing the torture might now result in their death however, so the CI once again has sought orders from the government as to what they are supposed to do..."
holpostel.34.a:0 "We'll keep going until they speak or die!"
holpostel.34.b:0 "It's not worth the effort."

holpostel.35.t:0 "French Nationals Die"
holpostel.35.d:0 "After a prolonged interrogation, that became very emotional for a while, one by one the French nationals somehow ended up dead. Obviously it was purely accidental and of course we had nothing to do with it as we would never violate the constitution by torturing these people. Still, the fact remains that we still do not know what they were planning with those explosives, but at least the world is better off with seven syndicalists removed from it."
holpostel.35.a:0 "Put the designer of the interrogation room on trial for manslaughter!"

holpostel.36.t:0 "Centraal Station Bombing"
holpostel.36.d:0 "The Amsterdam Central Station, the heart of rail infrastructure in our country, has today been blown up resulting in 127 deaths. Responsibility was claimed by a small syndicalist group affiliated with the Communard Sorelian faction in France.\nAfter investigation of the debris, it appears that the explosives used are the same as those confiscated from a group of French nationals that were smuggling them. It appears that this was a tragedy that could have been avoided."
holpostel.36.a:0 "Verdomde Syndies!"

holpostel.37.t:0 "Torture Story Leaks!"
holpostel.37.d:0 "How it has ended up the hands of the press no-one knows, but the fact is that they somehow acquired a copy of the document sanctioning the CI to torture the French nationals we arrested at the border not so long ago.\nThis will only strengthen the syndicalists in their rhetoric that the Dutch government is in fact a banana republic that is violating its own constitution. They will inevitably state that we are not even close to the democracy we portray ourselves as and that the Dutch regime will need to be replaced with a syndicalist model."
holpostel.37.a:0 "Aargh."

holpostel.38.t:0 "Revolutionary Statue Vandalised!"
holpostel.38.d:0 "A statue in Rotterdam erected in honour of the revolution has been besmirched in orange, white and blue by a filthy reactionary. Sadly the response is that more and more young people, who admire the courage of the deed, have been inspired to follow the anti-revolutionary underground 국가재건연합, who are plotting to take down the fragile nation we have just established. If we are to prevent a growth of this form of underground resistance, we must crack down hard on this!"
holpostel.38.a:0 "Crack down on all anti-revolutionaries in Rotterdam!"
holpostel.38.b:0 "Just wash it off!"

holpostel.39.t:0 "Assassination in Utrecht"
holpostel.39.d:0 "Johan Albarda drove through Utrecht today on his way for a public event. He was accompanied by the minister of interior, Wilem Drees as he went.\nSadly, a lone gunman, a member of the 국가재건연합, decided to take aim for Albarda. Sadly for him though, Drees and Albarda wear similar suits, and from his location the gunman is unable to recognise who is who his target is; he has to take a guess. Which man should he shoot?"
holpostel.39.a:0 "The man on the left."
holpostel.39.b:0 "The man on the right."

holpostel.40.t:0 "Assassin Arrested"
holpostel.40.d:0 "The police are reported to have arrested the lone gunman responsible for the assassination. He goes by the name of Peter Ton and appears to be an active member of the 국가재건연합, as well as fiercely opposed to everything affiliated with socialism. For now he's being held at the prison in Vught."
holpostel.40.a:0 "Good!"

holpostel.41.t:0 "Vught Prison Siege"
holpostel.41.d:0 "A huge crowd gathered today in Vught, demanding the prison hand over Peter Ton to them. It didn't take long for the pressure to build leading to the prison kommandant giving Ton up, resulting in him being lynched on the spot by the furious crowd. In the throes of victory, the mob have started to demand that the prison releases syndicalists imprisoned there and deliver other right-wingers to them, presumably to do the same to them!"
holpostel.41.a:0 "Intervene fast!"
holpostel.41.b:0 "They asked for it!"

holpostel.42.t:0 "반-우파 폭동 해산"
holpostel.42.d:0 "몇몇 사회민주주의 정치인들의 연설에 이어, 전국의 우익 인사들과 단체들을 대상으로 들고일어난 폭도들은 생디칼리스트들의 확고한 선동에 흩어지기 시작했습니다."
holpostel.42.a:0 "우리는 또 한번 위기로부터 살아남았다."

holpostel.43.t:0 "Amerikagangers"
holpostel.43.d:0 "Amerikagangers or 'America-goers' are Dutch syndicalists that have assembled in large groups to prepare to fight as volunteers with the Combined Syndicates in the American Civil War. Their preparations are almost complete which poses a problem for our government as to how to approach them. If we let them leave it could jeopardise potential future relations with whichever non-syndicalist power is victorious in America.\n\nWithin the government, most people are advocating forfeiture of citizenship if they join the syndicalist army, as per the law; some say the Dutch expression 'prevention is better than to cure' applies here, and then there are some who think we should just let them spend their holiday in America."
holpostel.43.a:0 "Confiscate their passports."
holpostel.43.b:0 "Warn them they will lose their citizenship."
holpostel.43.c:0 "Just let them go."

holpostel.44.t:0 "Dutch Volunteers Arrive"
holpostel.44.d:0 "Dutch volunteers have arrived to help the syndicalist cause; they are not very well trained however and their division is rather small, so we may need to invest in them in order to make them a significant fighting force or just throw them at the enemy, which will probably result in high casualties."
holpostel.44.a:0 "We need all help we can get!"

holpostel.45.t:0 "Annual 국가재건연합 Landdag"
holpostel.45.d:0 "The annual 국가재건연합 landdag will start in a week in Utrecht, the first one since the 1937 elections. The CI, the Dutch secret service, has found out that they will be announcing a major policy change for coming year and they themselves seem rather certain that this will result in a boost of support for their movement, reinforced by the fact that the 국가재건연합 is encouraging non-members to come as well. The CI has sadly not been able to retrieve information about the said policy change.\n\nSome are saying that the ideology of the 국가재건연합 is dangerous and that it would be best if we stop the landdag from occurring at all, possibly through revoking their permit to hold a rally; others say this gathering is protected by freedom of speech and should just go ahead."
holpostel.45.a:0 "The landdag may go ahead."
holpostel.45.b:0 "Revoke their permit."

holpostel.46.t:0 "국가재건연합 National Landdag 1937"
holpostel.46.d:0 "As expected the 국가재건연합 national landdag in the Utrechtse Jaarbeurs went ahead today. First 국가재건연합 leader Swart held a little inspiring cliché-speech about how much the movement had grown since he joined, but the truly interesting part came after that. Deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming the 국가재건연합's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while also curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the 기독국민동맹 in favour of the 국가재건연합."
holpostel.46.a:0 "I'm glad it's over."

holpostel.47.t:0 "국가재건연합 Landdag in Nijmegen?"
holpostel.47.d:0 "After their permit for a rally in Utrecht was revoked, the 국가재건연합 leadership has now asked the municipality of Nijmegen to allow a rally in the open air. Nijmegen is much more remote than Utrecht, and so it will probably attract far fewer visitors."
holpostel.47.a:0 "Alright then!"
holpostel.47.b:0 "No, thank you."

holpostel.48.t:0 "국가재건연합 National Landdag 1937"
holpostel.48.d:0 "Though expected to take place in Utrecht, the 국가재건연합 national landdag went ahead in Nijmegen today. First 국가재건연합 leader Swart held a little convincing speech condemning the municipal authorities in Utrecht for revoking the permit to rally in the jaarbeurs there. After that, the interesting part came, when deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming 국가재건연합's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the 기독국민동맹 in favour of the 국가재건연합, although the new location of the landdag is probably less ideal for attracting new members."
holpostel.48.a:0 "I'm glad it's over."

holpostel.49.t:0 "국가재건연합 Landdag in Antwerpen?"
holpostel.49.d:0 "The Dutch far-right party 국가재건연합 is requesting the right to hold a rally in Antwerpen. Apparently their permit to hold a rally was revoked in the Netherlands itself and attempts to choose a different location or time also failed, with the help of their hostile government. Now they are asking us if they may hold the landdag in Antwerpen, outside the authority of the Dutch government, so that they can in fact hold their landdag."
holpostel.49.a:0 "Flanders-Wallonia welcomes you!"
holpostel.49.b:0 "Surely their permit was revoked for a reason!"

holpostel.50.t:0 "국가재건연합 National Landdag 1937"

It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the 기독국민동맹 in favour of the 국가재건연합, although most would-be new members probably won't like having to go to Flanders-Wallonia to attend the rally."

holpostel.51.t:0 "국가재건연합 National Landdag Cancelled"
holpostel.51.d:0 "Following the failure to find a location to hold the landdag, the 국가재건연합 leadership has declared the cancellation of the annual landdag of 1937 and condemned us for being the primary cause for it. They also said that they won't let themselves be muzzled and that the landdag of 1938 will be held properly prepared to deal with another so-called cowardly attempt by the government to stop them."
holpostel.51.a:0 "Take that, populists!"

holpostel.52.t:0 "국가재건연합 Demonstration during Prinsjesdag"
holpostel.52.d:0 "Prinsjesdag is the day the Dutch government publicises its plans for spending for the next year: the Queen will read out the annual plans of the government and it is usually a festive affair, however this year the 국가재건연합 has started a demonstration along the road where the Queen will pass, flying their black flags, beating up alleged syndicalists and using their party greeting 'houzee' towards Cornelis van Geelkerken, deputy leader of the 국가재건연합, who is present. The mayor of The Hague wants to let the police break up the demonstration as he fears it would pose a threat to public order and the safety of the royal family. On the other hand, the 국가재건연합-opposition in the municipal council of The Hague says this is an essential part of freedom of speech and asserts that the 국가재건연합 will not attack the Royal family."
holpostel.52.a:0 "Remove them."
holpostel.52.b:0 "Let them hold their silly little protest."

holpostel.53.t:0 "Nationaal Herstel Expands"
holpostel.53.d:0 "The far-right newspaper 'Nationaal Herstel', closely affiliated with the 국가재건연합, has recruited two high-profile reporters today. Some consider this a threat as it will likely broaden the appeal of the newspaper that spreads unconventional ideas and is in fact a propaganda tool for the 국가재건연합 and the far right in general. Purely legally speaking however, there is no real basis to ban the paper, as it would be both contrary to freedom of the press and freedom of speech, two values that normally are respected within our country."
holpostel.53.a:0 "Just ban it already."
holpostel.53.b:0 "Leave them alone."

holpostel.54.t:0 "란트바흐트가 파업을 끝장내다"
holpostel.54.d:0 "The Landwacht has broken a local strike today, resulting in an excellent photo-opportunity with the company's employers stemming from the Landwacht's, and by extension the 국가재건연합's, willingness to act where the government didn't want to do so. Some are calling for a response against this action saying that the strike was justified, that the government didn't put it down for a reason and that the Landwacht had no right to do it in the government's place."

The police are ready to intervene, but in governmental circles there is uncertainty as to who should be targeted. Some say that the Red Front counter-demonstration was a direct attack on the pro-국가재건연합 demonstrators, so only Red Front members should be arrested. Others however say that the 국가재건연합ers should not have immediately have picked a fight with their long sticks when they spotted the Red Front counter-movement."
holpostel.55.a:0 "Only arrest syndicalists."
holpostel.55.b:0 "Objectively arrest everyone who caused trouble."

holpostel.56.t:0 "Nationale Jeugdstorm"
holpostel.56.d:0 "The 국가재건연합 has today announced the founding of the nationale jeugdstorm. It is in effect a scouting organisation, but it appears to be seen by 국가재건연합 leadership as a way to expand on the growing appeal the 국가재건연합 has on the younger generation and to set up an ideological base among those that are at this point in time too young to vote but who will attain that age within the coming years."
holpostel.56.a:0 "Dangerous, ban the institution!"
holpostel.56.b:0 "An initiative that only should be applauded!"

holpostel.57.t:0 "Military voices support for the 국가재건연합"
holpostel.57.d:0 "Several high ranking officers have today publicly voiced their support for the 국가재건연합, in particular the more moderate part represented by Henri Swart. They released a manifesto detailing their reasoning behind this move that details how they feel misrepresented by the democratic government and how the government is unwilling to truly serve Dutch interests. This is a sign that 국가재건연합 support may be greater than previously expected. While these are only officers it is probable that this sentiment is present amongst the common soldiery as well, and so some officials have proposed measures to limit 국가재건연합 presence in the military."
holpostel.57.a:0 "Institute those measures."

holpostel.58.d:0 "Tensions have been brewing for some time already, and the 국가재건연합 was already gaining increasing influence and popularity over the last few months, but today it all spilled over: a huge crowd in Landwacht uniforms gathered in Rotterdam and they collectively marched on The Hague, the seat of government.\nSeeing the huge crowd, and recognising that a civil war would be unavoidable in the event of resistance, the prime minister capitulated and accepted all of the 국가재건연합 crowd's demands: cabinet would become demissionary, and the 국가재건연합 would set up an extra-parliamentary cabinet which would be given emergency powers. A few hours later, and Dutch democracy was gone."

holpostel.59.d:0 "The Dutch far left had been gaining unprecedented momentum in recent months: record high membership records, influence in all layers of society and a growing feeling among the general populace that the current government is illegitimate. Today it all changed as nationwide, people went onto the streets, openly calling for the resignation of the government and for the establishment of a syndicalist state. Soon after, the petty bourgeois saw that they would never be able to crush the popular revolution and are crossing the border as we speak. The people have won today!"

holpostel.66.t:0 "기독국민동맹 Schism"
holpostel.66.d:0 "What many had already foreseen became reality today as a group of Catholic MPs announced that they would henceforth form the New 신로마가톨릭국가당, or New Roman Catholic State Party, faction - the 기독국민동맹 quickly fell apart.\n\nBefore the confessional parties united the Catholics had always had the most loyal base, and therefore the most seats - yet in the 기독국민동맹 the Protestants, the smaller party in the union, were somewhat controversially calling all the shots, as per the statement.\n\nLuckily, many Protestants of multiple denominations as well as several high ranking Catholics have expressed their support for continuing the 기독국민동맹, meaning that the cabinet can, thanks to our coalition with others, continue to rule."
holpostel.66.a:0 "It could have been worse."

holpostel.67.t:0 "기독국민동맹이 무너지다"
holpostel.67.d:0 "The 기독국민동맹 electoral pact was originally created to win victory in the 1937 elections, and once it failed in that goal its continued survival became increasingly precarious. Today matters came to a head as the Catholics announced their withdrawal from the pact and determination to refound their 로마가톨릭국가당 party. Shortly thereafter, former 기독역사연합 members announced that they too would leave the unstable union and thus, with no alliance anymore, the 반혁명당 has returned as well. So much for united confessional politics."
holpostel.67.a:0 "Conservative politics is splintered again."

holpostel.68.t:0 "Formation of the Labour Party"
holpostel.68.d:0 "After the 1937 victory through their 'Lijst Links', the 사회민주노동당 and 자유민주연맹 started flirting with the idea of permanently uniting the parties into one 'Party of Labour' or 'Partij van de Arbeid' in Dutch.\nBy late 1941, after almost completing a successful term of coalition rule in governing the country, both the annual landdag of the 사회민주노동당 and that of the 자유민주연맹 elected to dissolve partisan differences and found this party, with the former doing it very quietly to avoid angering more leftist members. This has resulted in the creation of a progressive juggernaut that could be a dominant force in Dutch politics for the rest of the century."

holpostel.69.t:0 "Committee Oud"
holpostel.69.d:0 "While for the 사회민주노동당 the merger was far less painless, there was certainly a lot more friction caused within the 자유민주연맹. At first the right-wing of the 자유민주연맹 saw it out, but now after two months the current prime minister Oud has formed 'Committee Oud' with other former 자유민주연맹 members who feel that the 노동당 has been kowtowing far too much towards social democratic views. Committee Oud has successfully negotiated a merger with the the market liberal 자유국가당, to form a more conservative liberal party that could also be a force to be reckoned with in post-Weltkrieg Dutch politics. All that is left is how the party should be named."
holpostel.69.a:0 "Partij van de Vrijheid, or 'Freedom Party'."

Many within the 국가재건연합 are arguing over whether we should do this: within the 국가재건연합, the stability argument is consistently raised, and many believe that elections should therefore be suspended. On the other hand holding the elections could also strengthen the 국가재건연합's grasp on power. In the 기독국민동맹, holding elections is seen as something that should be nurtured, if guided. If the elections are not suspended, the chance that they will move through fairly is still highly unlikely."

holpostel.89.d:0 "Despite his initial resistance to the idea, some special tools convinced Goulooze to share the location of his boss, 전국노동사무국-leader Harm Kolthek, with us.

holpostel.90.t:0 "Dutch Syndicalist Seeks Refuge"
holpostel.90.d:0 "The legislative building in the Netherlands was attacked a few days ago by a terrorist. Blaming the syndicalists for the endeavor, the Dutch authorities and their paramilitary supporters have started rounding up syndicalists all over the country. Now Harm Kolthek, the leader of the Dutch syndicalists, is being pursued by angry paramilitaries and he is requesting refuge in our embassy. There is a good chance that he will be killed if we do not assist him."

Conveniently for the syndicalist, the villa was just a few hundred metres from the Mexican embassy, the only country with ties to syndicalism that has a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands. Sadly, the Mexican ambassador decided that Kolthek could have his refuge, which means that according to international law, we cannot get him. The Landwacht is not officially part of the Dutch government however, and so Van Geelkerken has a choice."
holpostel.91.a:0 "Embassies are inviolable."

holpostel.93.t:0 "Dutch Embassy Raided!"
holpostel.93.d:0 "After seeing us granting refuge to Kolthek the Dutch 'Landwacht' paramilitary organisation decided to assault our embassy. According to early reports, they completely trashed the building and multiple members of our diplomatic mission have been wounded. Shockingly they've even kidnapped our ambassador, supposedly to hand him over to the police for helping a fugitive. While at least he was released by the Dutch police immediately, this violation is completely outrageous!"
holpostel.93.a:0 "48 hours to leave the country, Dutch ambassador!"

holpostel.94.t:0 "Mexican Embassy Raided"
holpostel.94.d:0 "The Landwacht simply assaulted the Mexican embassy upon finding out that they granted refuge to Kolthek, wounding several Mexican members of the mission in the process as well as extracting Kolthek and assuring the partial destruction of the embassy. They also, somewhat scandalously, handed the Mexican ambassador over to the police, claiming he 'was helping a fugitive'. We've released him at once, seeking to distance ourselves from this controversial deed by the Landwacht.\nIn any case, having successfully arrested Kolthek makes it unlikely that the moderate Sneevliet and radical Wijnkoop will be capable of working together in a revolt. Our sources already state that they are currently taking over a coastguard vessel to sail to the syndicalist sphere while the Red Front and moderates began to engage in brutal infighting."

Conveniently for the syndicalist, the villa was just one block away from the Mexican embassy, the only country with ties to syndicalism that has a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands. Sadly for Kolthek, they didn't want to grant him refuge, and as such the Landwacht arrested him. Now it seems highly unlikely that any leftist revolt in the short term will succeed, as moderate Sneevliet and radical Wijnkoop do not get along so well and the orthodox syndicalists were a binding factor. Our intelligence has suggested that both are now fleeing Groningen by boat into exile as the Red Front and moderates descend into acrimony."

The rebels have armed themselves and are harboured by a population that supports their efforts to overthrow the government. Unrest is growing in the rest of the country too, and some in the government are saying that it would be wise to set up a government in exile ready to restore rightful Dutch rule in case of collapse. Others, like Queen Wilhelmina, would rather see us try to quash the rebellion with force."

Within a few hours, redshirts had seized control of all major cities and the old plutocratic government evacuated the country, seemingly preparing a government in exile in the East Indies.

Today, in a giant demonstration, thousands of members of the party marched on the Binnenhof. The numbers involved were substantial, and realising that refusing their demands would lead to a bloody civil war, our government was forced to step down.

Street fights are happening daily across the country, and as police is unable to restore order, the military frequently needs to be deployed. Today, Reijnders, supreme commander of the Dutch armed forces, demanded that the government declare a state of emergency.

Military hotheads are proposing that we invade right now, while they still lack international recognition, but the Dutch, or Batavians as they call themselves now, are surely dug in having expected this move already. Others propose that we send agents to undermine the new regime's stability, which could be a more subtle way of securing their loyalty.

While there does not seem to be a very extensive independence movement in the region, likely due to the lacking development of the area, proposals have been pitched to send the exiled independence activist Anton de Kom back to Paramaribo to establish a socialist republic in Suriname."

hol.200.d:0 "Tensions are running high around us, causing our army staff to hold a meeting to decide upon a doctrine for our army.\n The more traditional part of our general staff wishes to concentrate on the defence our country, repairing and reactivating the traditional defensive lines making use of the water to stop the enemy.\n However, some note that these tactics may not work anymore due to the changing nature of warfare, and have expressed that the Dutch army should be a highly mobile force capable with motorised troops and tanks to respond to threats quickly and decisively.\n More naval oriented officers however see the role of the army to be a subsidary of our naval force, with an army of specialists conducting operations around our empire allowing for a small but highly efficient army while the navy keeps the enemy at bay."
hol.200.a:0 "We need to make Holland an impenetrable fortress!"
hol.200.b:0 "Our army is useless cowering in bunkers, trucks and tanks are what we need."

hol.201.t:0 "네덜란드 해군의 미래"
hol.201.d:0 "The Admiralty is discussing the best way to proceed onwards. Our resources are limited, so a plan is needs to be devised on how to make use of our naval assets the most.\n\nSome of the admirality place our merchant fleet above all. They believe that if we merchant fleet is unable to operate, our country will be reduced to poverty. They want to emphasise the need of our navy to protect the fleet with fast surface ships, and if possible harass the fleet of potential adversaries with submarines.\nArguments to focus on large surface ships to protect our vital colonies from a potential Japanese incursion are also heared. Our capital ships are reaching an respectable vintage and will probably not be able to protect the Dutch East Indies in particular if they are not modernised or even expanded in number.\n\nSome propose the Dutch navy to focus on naval aviation, a relatively new but potentially radically altering the way how naval battles are fought in the future. They wish to see a further expansion of the carrier force supported by a strong naval aviation branch."
hol.201.a:0 "Our merchant fleet needs to be protected at all times."
hol.201.b:0 "The Japanese are indeed an ever growing threat, we must focus on our capital ships."

Seeing the opportunity this presents, Royal Dutch Shell has asked the government to lease a large piece of land near Willemstad to construct a new refinery.\n\n If we agree to this, we will also need to construct new docking facilities for oil tankers to enter and leave the harbour.\n\nThe construction of the refinery will give a massive economic boost to the Dutch Antilles, however it might put us on odds against Venezuela... especially considering the fact that they claim these islands as theirs."

holfocus.4.d:0 "Although the vast majority of our resources come from our colonies, our homeland should also harbour some resources we have not yet unconvered.\n\nGeological surveys in Brabant have found traces of tungsten, a resource we thus far completly lack. Furthermore, we can dig deeper in our mines in southern Limburg and perhaps find usable iron for our smelters to produce steel from."

holfocus.7.t:0 "홀란드 요새"
holfocus.7.d:0 "We have started with the construction of Vesting Holland. The plan will be to surround Holland, the industrial and political heart of the Netherlands, with fortifications so that our defensive positions will be secure in any future war. Should we start construction?"

holfocus.8.t:0 "홀란드 요새의 첫 단계가 끝나다"
holfocus.8.d:0 "Phase 1 of Vesting Holland has been completed: a limited layer of fortifications hopefully capable of strengthening our defensive capabilities to at least an extent. The project is not finished, however, as much more can be done."
holfocus.8.a:0 "Voortreffelijk!"

holfocus.9.t:0 "홀란드 요새가 완공되다"
holfocus.9.d:0 "We have completed Vesting Holland. Our most important defensive lines are sufficiently secured and any enemy would have to go through a lot more trouble to reach our homeland.

holfocus.9.a:0 "We can sleep easy at night now!"

holfocus.10.t:0 "Question of the 사회민주노동당"
holfocus.10.d:0 "Following the removal of the shackles of capitalist rule, the workers have successfully abolished the States-General and are preparing to elect a third National Assembly. One of the first orders of business is whether to allow the 사회민주노동당 to partake in the upcoming elections; most other remnants of bourgeois elitism may not, but the 사회민주노동당 have once before tried to jumpstart the revolution, granting them some measure of gruding respect amongst other leftist groups. Unfortunately the 사회민주노동당 have been drifting to the right in recent years, which is one of our main concerns - they could provide a backdoor to subvert the revolution."
holfocus.10.a:0 "Let the 사회민주노동당 take part."

holfocus.14.a:0 "That's one dystopian prediction..."

holfocus.15.t:0 "Battle for Gouda"
holfocus.15.d:0 "The Red Front and Landwacht were planning to turn the city of Gouda into one huge riot, but we were prepared this time; in a grand operation where the police, military and intelligence government groups worked together, we made sure we had a sizeable police force ready. Using that force, we took down local leadership of both sides, dispersing the crowds. Even if there had been some deaths, it is clear that every would-be fight between them will be met with the same force, until they run out of fighting power."
holfocus.15.a:0 "That's good."

holfocus.16.t:0 "Rebuilding the Binnenhof"
holfocus.16.d:0 "Now that the filthy syndicalists have burned down the Binnenhof, it is up to us to build a replacement so that our centre of power is sheltered and that our government can once again function in The Hague, rather than Amsterdam where we are now temporarily located."
holfocus.16.a:0 "In these times of crisis, we should keep it small."
holfocus.16.b:0 "Just rebuild the old Binnenhof."
holfocus.16.c:0 "Create a giant art-deco style testament to the Dutch spirit!"

holfocus.17.t:0 "파푸아 수용소"
holfocus.17.d:0 "While camps in West Guinea were always used to store dissidents in the Indies, shipping syndicalists from the mainland Netherlands is actually something we have yet to put into practice despite suggestions. The great advantage of camps in New Guinea compared to a prison in Vught is that syndicalists cannot just flee for France or Britain upon escape and the thick jungle and rumours of native man-eating tribes were a good reason to continue labouring. Following the building of several new camps, there is now room for syndicalists to be arrested and shipped there en-masse."
holfocus.17.a:0 "Let them fester on that malaria-ridden rock."

holfocus.18.t:0 "Zonderlinge Zaterdag"
holfocus.18.d:0 "Early this morning, the Landwacht was found to be unusually active on the streets of Amsterdam. Around 10 a group of around seventy-five Landwachters were spotted marching into the Palace on the edge of Dam Square, the place where Henri Swart's office is. Upon entry into the office their intentions have quickly become clear: they are demanding that Swart publicly resign from his position and prepare for a handover of power. With Swart placed on air on the national broadcaster, the nation's fate hangs on a knife-edge."
holfocus.18.a:0 "The police burst in and seize the conspirators."
holfocus.18.b:0 "Swart publicly resigns."

holfocus.19.t:0 "무역 사절단"
holfocus.19.d:0 "The Netherlands, to put it bluntly, is an export economy. One of the main issues affecting our nations in recent years is that almost all of our exports go to Germany, meaning that now that the Reich's willingness to engage in overseas trade has plummeted, our own economy suffers. In an effort to diversify our export partners, we could approach the nearby Scandinavians, or look beyond Europe to the Americas for new markets."
holfocus.19.a:0 "Send the mission to Scandinavia."
holfocus.19.b:0 "Send the mission to North America."
holfocus.19.c:0 "Send the mission to South America."

holfocus.20.t:0 "Dutch Trade Mission Arrives"
holfocus.20.d:0 "A Dutch trade mission has arrived. They hope to negotiate a treaty so that at least some trade barriers can be removed, a highly unusual request in these times of crisis. Regardless, agreeing to it could boost our trade with each other, but cynics point out that this is probably more an attempt by the Dutch to get out of German economic dependency than them caring for our mutual economic prospects."
holfocus.20.a:0 "Trade barriers begone."
holfocus.20.b:0 "No, the barriers are fine as it is."

holfocus.21.t:0 "Trade Mission Reports Back"
holfocus.21.d:0 "Our trade mission has returned from their trip. Outside of great stories of those who came along about what had happened during it they are also reporting on the gains they have made."
holfocus.21.a:0 "Let's see!"

holfocus.22.t:0 "Welfare Negotiations"
holfocus.22.d:0 "One of the first demands the leftists came up with was some limited reforms in welfare and regulation; ranging from shorter working hours to mandatory safety regulation to subsidies for unemployed and those not able to work at all."
holfocus.22.a:0 "A despicably un-Dutch proposal!"
holfocus.22.b:0 "Some reforms should be fine."
holfocus.22.c:0 "Implement all of their reforms."

holfocus.23.t:0 "Communard Diplomatic Status Negotiations"
holfocus.23.d:0 "While most 'conventional' countries have the tendency to recognise governments-in-exile like Canada and National France over the syndicalists ruling their homeland, the Netherlands were also one of the few countries who viciously refused to even de-facto recognising their existence. That may change now, because the leftists demand we negotiate with the Commune of France for a diplomatic mission in the interests of our citizens travelling there."
holfocus.23.a:0 "We don't negotiate with terrorists!"
holfocus.23.b:0 "Fine, but we will explicitly deny de-facto recognition!"
holfocus.23.c:0 "Alright, but we won't say this is de-jure recognition!"

holfocus.24.t:0 "반 란트바흐트 보호 협상"
holfocus.24.d:0 "The leftists are demanding that we divert manpower in order to protect them from 'blackshirted thugs', after consulting our spy in the 전국노동사무국 it was found out that they meant the Landwacht with this. Still, diverting our precious manpower to defending some lefties is especially in 기독국민동맹 spheres seen as completely unacceptable!"
holfocus.24.a:0 "We're not going to do that."
holfocus.24.b:0 "Divert a few reservists."
holfocus.24.c:0 "Give them what they want."

holfocus.25.t:0 "적색 전선 제한 협상"
holfocus.25.d:0 "The Red Front is arguably one of the biggest threats to civil peace in the Netherlands as they have a tendency to constantly brawl with the Landwacht. Demanding that they restrain themselves in the deal is a no-brainer, but the lefties won't just go for that."
holfocus.25.a:0 "Demand must cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.25.b:0 "They may henceforth only defend their activists from the Landwacht."
holfocus.25.c:0 "Don't restrict their rights in the deal."

holfocus.26.t:0 "전국노동사무국 Negotiations"
holfocus.26.d:0 "The 전국노동사무국, arguably the most important syndicalist union in the Netherlands, has the potential to bring our economy to ruin and furthermore, taking at away will damage the influence of orthodox syndicalism, probably badly!"
holfocus.26.a:0 "Demand they cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.26.b:0 "They must merge with the social democratic NVV!"
holfocus.26.c:0 "Don't make demands of them."

holfocus.27.t:0 "혁명사회노동당 Negotiations"
holfocus.27.d:0 "The 혁명사회노동당 is the only far-left party represented in parliament, mainly because the rest of the left rejects our parliament's legitimacy. Still, they are a threat to our current system, as they would no doubt dissolve it if they came to power. Limiting what they can do will diminish the political influence of the radical socialists as well."

holfocus.28.d:0 "The Landwacht is an obvious problem with regards to keeping the streets of the Netherlands safe, as they seem to constantly start brawling with leftwingers. The Dutch government wants to make clear that the Landwacht should make way for the police to round up troublemakers where needed."
holfocus.28.a:0 "Demand they cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.28.b:0 "They may henceforth only defend their activists from the Red Front."
holfocus.28.c:0 "Don't restrict their rights in the deal."

holfocus.29.t:0 "Military Influence Negotiations"
holfocus.29.d:0 "A large problem iss that a lot old-guard officers in our military is member of the 국가재건연합 at the behalf of their 'moderate-but-still-authoritarian' faction. This undermines the reliability of our military and makes a putsch by the 국가재건연합 possible. We are determined to change this, and moreso by altering their party rules."
holfocus.29.a:0 "Demand that one can no longer be actively in the military and be a 국가재건연합-member."

holfocus.29.c:0 "Don't push this issue."

holfocus.30.t:0 "국가재건연합 Rally Negotiations"
holfocus.30.d:0 "One of the most important reasons that the 국가재건연합 is growing so fast in recent years is that Van Geelkerken is holding enormous party rallies propagating a future under the 국가재건연합. This leads to growth of a radical young guard and it is proving to be a threat to our parliamentary system."
holfocus.30.a:0 "Demand that these rallies will no longer be held."
holfocus.30.b:0 "Only allow it at the annual 국가재건연합 landdag."
holfocus.30.c:0 "Don't put restrictions on it like that."

holfocus.31.t:0 "Union Rights Negotiations"
holfocus.31.d:0 "The first demand the 국가재건연합 placed down was that we ban trade unions as they are, as the 국가재건연합's Van Geelkerken states, 'thugs who only seek to sabotage our nation'. This would be neither stabilising nor popular, however."
holfocus.31.a:0 "Strong unions are vital to our society."
holfocus.31.b:0 "Limit their rights, but don't outright ban them."
holfocus.31.c:0 "Ban the unions as demanded."

holfocus.32.t:0 "Tariff Negotiations"
holfocus.32.d:0 "The 국가재건연합 demands that we protect Dutch businesses through tariffs to make foreign goods more expensive. The Netherlands is an export country however and overdoing this is risking a trade war that we cannot afford, so the government must remain cautious."
holfocus.32.a:0 "We don't do tariffs."
holfocus.32.b:0 "Some tariffs are acceptable."
holfocus.32.c:0 "Implement all the tariffs they want."

holfocus.33.t:0 "Nationalisation Negotiations"
holfocus.33.d:0 "The most controversial demand of the populists was that we would nationalise all German property in the Netherlands. Some are afraid that doing this will bring upon us the wrath of the Kaiserreich."
holfocus.33.a:0 "We're nationalising nothing!"
holfocus.33.b:0 "Germans don't need all that property."

holfocus.34.a:0 "Excellent news!"

holfocus.36.t:0 "Negotiations Failed with the Syndicalists"
holfocus.36.d:0 "The syndicalists have left the negotiation as they feel we are willing to give away too little to force actual change through. As such the negotiations have fallen apart and the chances of a deal are now minimal."
holfocus.36.a:0 "Sodding reds."

holfocus.37.t:0 "Successful Negotiations with the Nationalists "
holfocus.37.d:0 "We have successfully negotiated a deal with the extreme right. Now it is time to implement our part of the deal and see them implement their part."
holfocus.37.a:0 "Neat."

holfocus.39.t:0 "Negotiations Failed with the Nationalists"
holfocus.39.d:0 "The 국가재건연합 has left the negotiation table as they feel that 'we are too weak to even stand a chance at saving the country' and that they would have to give too much away to end with a deal. Negotiations have thus fallen apart and of the chances a deal after all are slim."
holfocus.39.a:0 "These extremists really are a piece of work."

holfocus.40.d.b:0 "The Dutch government has grudgingly approached us to exchange diplomatic missions between our countries, though they have said that this amounts to no recognition of our government at all. This is insulting, but our sources say this move stems from negotiations with our comrades there, so perhaps we could pressure them into recognising our government."

holfocus.42.d:0 "The French Communards have accepted our proposal to exchange diplomatic missions, and the necessary preparations to buy a building in Paris and The Hague by our countries respectively has started. The syndicalists will be satisfied which will cement our deal."
holfocus.42.a:0 "I still don't like this."

holfocus.43.t:0 "Commune Demands De-Jure Recognition"
holfocus.43.d:0 "The French have said that they will only accept our proposal if we officially recognise their government, something objectively not possible without repealing our recognition of National France. Besides that it also makes our government look weak. Not doing it might jeopardise our deal with the left though..."
holfocus.43.a:0 "Never!"
holfocus.43.b:0 "Ok then..."

holfocus.44.t:0 "네덜란드가 외교적으로 인정하다"
holfocus.44.d:0 "The Dutch government has given in to our pressure and is now recognising us as the legitimate government of France. Their government has suffered a humiliating political loss while we have gained a massive diplomatic win on the world stage."
holfocus.44.a:0 "Pressure helps!"

holfocus.45.t:0 "네덜란드가 인정하기를 거부하다"
holfocus.45.d:0 "Despite our pressure, the Dutch have refused to recognise us. While this means no diplomatic missions it is not particularly crushing for us. We could however tell the Dutch syndicalists how awfully unreasonable their government was, with their outrageous demands... like... well we will just have to make something up!"
holfocus.45.a:0 "No, its better to just leave it at this!"
holfocus.45.b:0 "Let me think of some outrageous demands..."

holfocus.46.t:0 "Syndicalists Protest"
holfocus.46.d:0 "When we didn't hear back from the Communards, we assumed that it was no deal. However, now the syndicalist negotiators have appeared saying that we made outrageous demands of the Communard government and that we intentionally blew the negotiations to punish them..."
holfocus.46.a:0 "OK, OK, we'll recognise them!"
holfocus.46.b:0 "We deny this and we won't go back."

holfocus.47.t:0 "네덜란드가 독일인들의 자산을 국유화하다"
holfocus.47.d.a:0 "The Dutch government has announced a large-scale nationalisation programme following negotiations with their ultranationalists. They are targeting German property across their country and voices from left to right of the political spectrum are calling for action to defend German interests."
holfocus.47.d.b:0 "The Dutch government has announced a small-scale nationalisation programme that seems to be solely targeting Germans. There has been some outrage in German politics about this and there are calls for us to do something to safeguard German interests in our small neighbour."
holfocus.47.a:0 "The German military will safeguard German interests."
holfocus.47.b:0 "Give it up or lose access to the Reichspakt markets."
holfocus.47.c:0 "There is nothing we can do."

holfocus.48.t:0 "독일의 군사 제재 최후 통첩"
holfocus.48.d:0 "The Germans have sent an ultimatum: either we cancel our nationalisation plans or the German Heer will intervene to protect German interests by force. It appears like we have little choice but to cancel, even if it would not be popular with our new nationalistic partners or even moderates."
holfocus.48.a:0 "They're bluffing!"
holfocus.48.b:0 "We would be squashed under their heel."

holfocus.49.t:0 "네덜란드가 우리의 최후 통첩을 무시하다"
holfocus.49.d:0 "The Dutch apparently think we are bluffing, and have refused to call off the nationalisation. While not attacking now would have us lose face in the international community, some are saying that it is unwise to attack a 'normal' country while the syndicalists knock at our gates. Besides, that nationalisation is hardly a valid casus belli."
holfocus.49.a:0 "War it is!"
holfocus.49.b:0 "Don't act on it."

holfocus.50.t:0 "독일의 경제 제재 최후 통첩"
holfocus.50.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has demanded that we cancel our nationalisation, and that if we fail to do so they will remove our access to the Reichspakt market, which could potentially ruin our economy. Caving in will likely anger our nationalistic partners however."
holfocus.50.a:0 "Thanks to policy and Black Monday we can afford it."
holfocus.50.b:0 "We have no choice."

holfocus.51.t:0 "네덜란드가 우리의 최후 통첩을 무시하다"
holfocus.51.d:0 "In spite of our threats, the Dutch have refused to cancel the nationalisation process. Now it is up to us to decide whether we will go through with our threat or just let it slide."
holfocus.51.a:0 "You'll get your embargo."
holfocus.51.b:0 "Sliding sounds nice."

holfocus.52.t:0 "Dutch Cave In"
holfocus.52.d:0 "Following our pressure the Dutch have caved in and German property will not be nationalised. Those owning assets in the Netherlands have cheered the strong reaction of the German government and showered praise upon us for not letting them be bullied by our tiny neighbour's government."
holfocus.52.a:0 "That will teach them."

holfocus.53.t:0 "국가재건연합 Publicly Denounces Us"
holfocus.53.d:0 "Our 'partners', the 국가재건연합, have publicly denounced the way we handeled the German diplomatic row, saying that we failed to do what it took to serve our country's best interesdt and that we let the German violate our sovereignty. So much for our deal."
holfocus.53.a:0 "It can hardly be cancelled if it never truly existed!"

holfocus.54.t:0 "Government Negotiations Collapse"
holfocus.54.d:0 "Following the failure to negotiate a deal with either the left or the right, the 기독국민동맹 and 자유국가당 are both polling at historically low levels, with most of their voters having defected to the 사회민주노동당 and 자유민주연맹. At the same time, the far left and far right are intending to boycott the elections. The 자유국가당 has sought to return to the negotiating table, but the 기독국민동맹 claims the time for talk is over. It turns out they couldn't get out."
holfocus.54.a:0 "We need new elections in a few month time!"

holfocus.55.t:0 "[GetYear]년 선거"
holfocus.55.d:0 "Following the fall of the Cabinet of the 기독국민동맹 and 자유국가당, elections were ordered to be held. The 사회민주노동당 and 자유민주연맹 are said to stand a good chance as their interventions have caused the 기독국민동맹 and 자유국가당 to lose a lot of support and their bad experience with working with the democratic parties had caused both the 국가재건연합 and the 혁명사회노동당 to boycott the elections, at least this time around."
holfocus.55.a:0 "The 사회민주노동당 beats the 기독국민동맹."
holfocus.55.b:0 "The 기독국민동맹 remains the largest, but loses its majority."

holfocus.56.d:0 "Having become the largest party in the house, the 사회민주노동당 get the first chance to form a government. It has not taken long to make a deal with the 자유민주연맹, who are the only ones willing to rule with them. The only dark spot of the whole affair has been that Queen Wilhelmina has refused to give Albarda the posto of Formateur, meaning that it would have to be filled by 자유민주연맹-leader Oud."
holfocus.56.a:0 "And so cabinet Oud came to be."

holfocus.57.t:0 "사회민주노동당이 [GetYear]년 정부를 구성하다"
holfocus.57.d:0 "While the 기독국민동맹 again stood victorious, we unfortunately lost our majority. While we got the first shot at forming a government, we discovered that cruelly we could only do so if we made a deal with the 사회민주노동당 or 자유민주연맹 who saw each other as preferable partners. After failing to find a viable partner, we had to give the 사회민주노동당 a chance. The 사회민주노동당 formed a cabinet with the 자유민주연맹, for unknown reasons, though it is said the Queen was involved in negotiating that."

The Dutch people are tired of the violence in the streets between your factions and so am I. Rest assured that if any further violence by an organisation set up by members of your parties results in the 전국노동사무국, the  or 국가재건연합 being outlawed, the entire leadership of said organisation will be considered guilty of inciting violence.

holfocus.400.d:0 "Design on a Koolhoven high-performance aircraft first started late in 1937. The result, finished in early 1938 was the F.K.55, a single-seat fighter of radical design with contra-rotating propellers and an engine housed behind the pilot. It had initially been proposed to do away with ailerons on the wings, and replace them with "slot-spoilers" for lateral control, however this idea was abandoned early in the project."

holfocus.401.t:0 "포커 D.XXI가 개발되다"
holfocus.401.d:0 "The Fokker D.XXI was a low-wing monoplane fighter aircraft. Following standard Fokker design practice of the period, it featured a welded steel tube fuselage that was largely covered by fabric, including the flight control surfaces; element forward of the trailing edges of the wings were covered by detachable aluminium panels instead. The wings were of a wooden construction, being composed of two box spars attached to ribs made of plywood. The aircraft was outfitted with a fixed spatted undercarriage with cantilever legs; braking was provided by independently-operated pedals using compress air.\n\nThe cockpit of the D.XXI was fully enclosed by a plexiglas hood featuring large sliding sections, and was entirely jettisonable in an emergency situation to enable pilots to bail out. Two pilots were protected against turnover injuries by means of a pylon built into the structure of the aircraft set behind the seat. Fuel was housed in a 77-gallon tank located aft of the engine, wing-mounted auxiliary fuel tanks could also be installed.\nThe main armament consisted of two pairs of 7.92mm M36 FN-Browning machine guns, two being housed within the wings and the other pair within the forward fuselage, requiring the latter to shoot through the propeller blades; guns installed within the fuselage carried 500 rounds each while wing-mounted guns had 300 rounds each.\nUpon its entry to service in 1938, the D.XXI represented a significant leap forward for the Dutch Army Aviation Group, whose fighter force had until that time consisted of aging biplanes with open cockpits. The new Fokker quickly proved to be an extremely sturdy aircraft, being capable of attaining a speed of 700 km/h in a dive."

Although the plane is well liked by its pilots, it does have some room for improvement.\n\nSeveral design changes have been proposed, and one redesigned model with an upgraded engine and retractable landing gear is now ready for production.\nThis will provide a cheap boost to the combat worthyness of the Luchtvaartafdeling, as exisiting production lines can be used."

The children in any case are bound to approve; our former Queen's day fell in the summer holiday, but now they get an additional day off during the school term.\n\nThe date is not the only thing that is different this year, as contrary to Wilhelmina Queen Juliana has scheduled a public appearance on her Queen's Day: today she accepted a floral tribute, as her grandmother the Queen-Consort-Regentess, Emma always did."

While today's first celebration appears to have attracted merely some hardline syndicalists, there have been some moderates as well, so we have high hopes that next year will be a full-scale celebration. One blemish on the day was that we were forced to move the planned annual pensionary speech in Amsterdam to Groningen for security reasons."

It seems we have found an ideal alternative."
